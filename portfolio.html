            <h3>Project 1-(Stopwatch)</h3>
            <p>This project involves creating a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application
                 will allow users to start, pause, and reset a timer, as well as record lap times. HTML will be used for the
                structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing the stopwatch functionality. The goal is to
                   build an interactive and user-friendly tool for accurately measuring and recording time intervals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 2-(TicTacToe)</h3>
            <p>This project involves creating a Tic-Tac-Toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application
                 will enable two players to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 3x3 grid. HTML will provide the structure of
                  the game board, CSS will be used to style the game, and JavaScript will handle the game logic, including detecting
                   wins, draws, and switching turns between players. The goal is to create an interactive and engaging Tic-Tac-Toe
                    game that can be played directly in a web browser.</p>
